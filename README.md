📝 Recommendations
Based on the dashboard analysis:

[Actionable insight]: Increase marketing in California and New Hampshire due to high conversion rate. Stock less for products with lower sales and lower profit, such as Fasteners, labels, Envelopes and art

[Risk]: Experiencing losses in Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Colarado – review supply chain issues. The table sub-category is also experiencing loss.

[Opportunity]: Give discounts to returning customers to increase customer retention.
